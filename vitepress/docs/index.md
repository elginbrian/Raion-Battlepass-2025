# ⚔️ Raion Battlepass 2025

Hello our fellow developer 🧑‍💻

Welcome to the world of Raion Community! But before you truly become one of the family, there are some aspects of capabilities you need to possess. Once you show the capabilities we specify, it will be time for you to achieve the Raion Battlepass 2025. Without further ado, let us inform you about the Battlepass.

## ⚖ BATTLEPASS REQUIREMENT

- A working Mobile Application developed by yourself.
- The app can send HTTP REQUEST (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) from API asynchronously. (API Webpage)
- The app can display the list of data serialized from the API response to the user.
- UI/UX is less prioritized; as long as your code is working, then it's good to go. But bonus exp to those who submit a working app with a pleasing UI/UX.
- Mandatory to implement the MVVM architectural pattern\*\*\*.
- Mandatory to use Kotlin as the programming language\*\*\*.
- Bonus exp for those who can cache data from the API response to the local database (Room).
